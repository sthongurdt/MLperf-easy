# Extracting Results.

Extracting the results is simple. When you run oar_exec.sh, two files are created in the cluster directories you use. You must verify that the cluster directories exist.
Inside the cluster directory, you will find two files named OAR_%job_id%_framework_model.err and OAR_%job_id%_framework_model.out.
